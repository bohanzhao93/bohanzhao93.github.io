       I am deeply fascinated by the complex workings of the brain and its critical role in shaping behavior. My long-term goal is to understand *how our sensory system detects internal states and how such detection influences our behaviors*. My research journey began with a focus on learning and memory, and I have studied the encoding logic in the brain. Currently, I am exploring the relationship between the brain and adipose tissue, examining how metabolic states and the external environment interact with the brain to regulate behavioral choices. By linking these areas of research, my goal is to identify general principles from sensory detection to behavioral choices, thereby advancing our understanding of brain-body interaction. Please reach out to collaborate 😃
