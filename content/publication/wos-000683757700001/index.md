abstract: Multiple spaced trials of aversive differential conditioning can produce
  two independent long-term memories (LTMs) of opposite valence. One is an aversive
  memory for avoiding the conditioned stimulus (CS+), and the other is a safety memory
  for approaching the non-conditioned stimulus (CS-). Here, we show that a single
  trial of aversive differential conditioning yields one merged LTM (mLTM) for avoiding
  both CS+ and CS-. Such mLTM can be detected after sequential exposures to the shock-paired
  CS+ and -unpaired CS-, and be retrieved by either CS+ or CS-. The formation of mLTM
  relies on triggering aversive-reinforcing dopaminergic neurons and subsequent new
  protein synthesis. Expressing mLTM involves ab Kenyon cells and corresponding approach-directing
  mushroom body output neurons, in which similar-amplitude long-term depression of
  responses to CS+ and CS- seems to signal the mLTM. Our results suggest that animals
  can develop distinct strategies for occasional and repeated threatening experiences.
