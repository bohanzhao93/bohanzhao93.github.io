 abstract = {Multiple spaced trials of aversive differential conditioning can produce
two independent long-term memories (LTMs) of opposite valence. One is an
aversive memory for avoiding the conditioned stimulus (CS+), and the
other is a safety memory for approaching the non-conditioned stimulus
(CS-). Here, we show that a single trial of aversive differential
conditioning yields one merged LTM (mLTM) for avoiding both CS+ and CS-.
Such mLTM can be detected after sequential exposures to the shock-paired
CS+ and -unpaired CS-, and be retrieved by either CS+ or CS-. The
formation of mLTM relies on triggering aversive-reinforcing dopaminergic
neurons and subsequent new protein synthesis. Expressing mLTM involves
ab Kenyon cells and corresponding approach-directing mushroom body
output neurons, in which similar-amplitude long-term depression of
responses to CS+ and CS- seems to signal the mLTM. Our results suggest
that animals can develop distinct strategies for occasional and repeated
threatening experiences.},
