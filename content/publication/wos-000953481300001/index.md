abstract: Animals can continuously learn different tasks to adapt to changing environments
  and, therefore, have strategies to effectively cope with inter-task interference,
  including both proactive interference (Pro-I) and retroactive interference (Retro-I).
  Many biological mechanisms are known to contribute to learning, memory, and forgetting
  for a single task, however, mechanisms involved only when learning sequential different
  tasks are relatively poorly understood. Here, we dissect the respective molecular
  mechanisms of Pro-I and Retro-I between two consecutive associative learning tasks
  in Drosophila. Pro-I is more sensitive to an inter-task interval (ITI) than Retro-I.
  They occur together at short ITI (<20 min), while only Retro-I remains significant
  at ITI beyond 20 min. Acutely overexpressing Corkscrew (CSW), an evolutionarily
  conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, in mushroom body (MB) neurons reduces
  Pro-I, whereas acute knockdown of CSW exacerbates Pro-I. Such function of CSW is
  further found to rely on the ? subset of MB neurons and the downstream Raf/MAPK
  pathway. In contrast, manipulating CSW does not affect Retro-I as well as a single
  learning task. Interestingly, manipulation of Rac1, a molecule that regulates Retro-I,
  does not affect Pro-I. Thus, our findings suggest that learning different tasks
  consecutively triggers distinct molecular mechanisms to tune proactive and retroactive
  interference.
