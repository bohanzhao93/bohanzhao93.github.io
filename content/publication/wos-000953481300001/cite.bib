 abstract = {Animals can continuously learn different tasks to adapt to changing
environments and, therefore, have strategies to effectively cope with
inter-task interference, including both proactive interference (Pro-I)
and retroactive interference (Retro-I). Many biological mechanisms are
known to contribute to learning, memory, and forgetting for a single
task, however, mechanisms involved only when learning sequential
different tasks are relatively poorly understood. Here, we dissect the
respective molecular mechanisms of Pro-I and Retro-I between two
consecutive associative learning tasks in Drosophila. Pro-I is more
sensitive to an inter-task interval (ITI) than Retro-I. They occur
together at short ITI (<20 min), while only Retro-I remains significant
at ITI beyond 20 min. Acutely overexpressing Corkscrew (CSW), an
evolutionarily conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, in mushroom
body (MB) neurons reduces Pro-I, whereas acute knockdown of CSW
exacerbates Pro-I. Such function of CSW is further found to rely on the
? subset of MB neurons and the downstream Raf/MAPK pathway. In contrast,
manipulating CSW does not affect Retro-I as well as a single learning
task. Interestingly, manipulation of Rac1, a molecule that regulates
Retro-I, does not affect Pro-I. Thus, our findings suggest that learning
different tasks consecutively triggers distinct molecular mechanisms to
tune proactive and retroactive interference.},
