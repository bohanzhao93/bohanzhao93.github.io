abstract: The DNA barcoding gene COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) effectively
  identifies many species. Herein, we barcoded 172 individuals from 37 species belonging
  to nine genera in Rhacophoridae to test if the gene serves equally well to identify
  species of tree frogs. Phenetic neighbor joining and phylogenetic Bayesian inference
  were used to construct phylogenetic trees, which resolved all nine genera as monophyletic
  taxa except for Rhacophorus, two new matrilines for Liuixalus, and Polypedates leucomystax
  species complex. Intraspecific genetic distances ranged from 0.000 to 0.119 and
  interspecific genetic distances ranged from 0.015 to 0.334. Within Rhacophorus and
  Kurixalus, the intra- and interspecific genetic distances did not reveal an obvious
  barcode gap. Notwithstanding, we found that COI sequences unambiguously identified
  rhacophorid species and helped to discover likely new cryptic species via the synthesis
  of genealogical relationships and divergence patterns. Our results supported that
  COI is an effective DNA barcoding marker for Rhacophoridae.
