 abstract = {The DNA barcoding gene COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) effectively
identifies many species. Herein, we barcoded 172 individuals from 37
species belonging to nine genera in Rhacophoridae to test if the gene
serves equally well to identify species of tree frogs. Phenetic neighbor
joining and phylogenetic Bayesian inference were used to construct
phylogenetic trees, which resolved all nine genera as monophyletic taxa
except for Rhacophorus, two new matrilines for Liuixalus, and
Polypedates leucomystax species complex. Intraspecific genetic distances
ranged from 0.000 to 0.119 and interspecific genetic distances ranged
from 0.015 to 0.334. Within Rhacophorus and Kurixalus, the intra- and
interspecific genetic distances did not reveal an obvious barcode gap.
Notwithstanding, we found that COI sequences unambiguously identified
rhacophorid species and helped to discover likely new cryptic species
via the synthesis of genealogical relationships and divergence patterns.
Our results supported that COI is an effective DNA barcoding marker for
Rhacophoridae.},
