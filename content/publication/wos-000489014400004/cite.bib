 abstract = {It is believed that long-term memory (LTM) cannot be formed immediately
because it must go through a protein synthesis-dependent consolidation
process. However, the current study uses Drosophila aversive olfactory
conditioning to show that such processes are dispensable for
context-dependent LTM (cLTM). Single-trial conditioning yields cLTM that
is formed immediately in a protein-synthesis independent manner and is
sustained over 14 days without decay. Unlike retrieval of traditional
LTM, which requires only the conditioned odour and is mediated by
mushroom-body neurons, cLTM recall requires both the conditioned odour
and reinstatement of the training-environmental context. It is mediated
through lateral-horn neurons that connect to multiple sensory brain
regions. The cLTM cannot be retrieved if synaptic transmission from any
one of these centres is blocked, with effects similar to those of
altered encoding context during retrieval. The present study provides
strong evidence that long-term memory can be formed easily without the
need for consolidation.},
