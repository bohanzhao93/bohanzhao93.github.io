abstract: It is believed that long-term memory (LTM) cannot be formed immediately
  because it must go through a protein synthesis-dependent consolidation process.
  However, the current study uses Drosophila aversive olfactory conditioning to show
  that such processes are dispensable for context-dependent LTM (cLTM). Single-trial
  conditioning yields cLTM that is formed immediately in a protein-synthesis independent
  manner and is sustained over 14 days without decay. Unlike retrieval of traditional
  LTM, which requires only the conditioned odour and is mediated by mushroom-body
  neurons, cLTM recall requires both the conditioned odour and reinstatement of the
  training-environmental context. It is mediated through lateral-horn neurons that
  connect to multiple sensory brain regions. The cLTM cannot be retrieved if synaptic
  transmission from any one of these centres is blocked, with effects similar to those
  of altered encoding context during retrieval. The present study provides strong
  evidence that long-term memory can be formed easily without the need for consolidation.
