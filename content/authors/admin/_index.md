      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Welcome! I am an [AHA postdoctoral fellow](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/researchers-at-heart/new-2024-aha-research-awardees/postdoctoral-fellowship)  at the [neurometabolism lab](http://www.ye-lab.org) led by [Prof. Li Ye](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/ye/) at [**Scripps Research/HHMI**](https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/li-ye). Currently, I am focusing on adipose interception, aiming to understand brain-body interactions. Prior to this, I obtained my PhD in neuroscience under the supervision of [Prof. Yi Zhong](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1035/1105.htm) at **Tsinghua University**, where I investigated the encoding mechanisms of memory in _Drosophila_. After that, I explored sleep homeostatic regulations with [Prof. Gero MiesenbÃ¶ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gero_Miesenb%C3%B6ck) at the **University of Oxford**, where I developed skills in _in vivo_ electrophysiology and multiphoton imaging. Thank you for visiting my site!
