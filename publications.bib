Title = {DNA barcoding and the identification of tree frogs (Amphibia: Anura:

Abstract = {The DNA barcoding gene COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) effectively
   identifies many species. Herein, we barcoded 172 individuals from 37
   species belonging to nine genera in Rhacophoridae to test if the gene
   serves equally well to identify species of tree frogs. Phenetic neighbor
   joining and phylogenetic Bayesian inference were used to construct
   phylogenetic trees, which resolved all nine genera as monophyletic taxa
   except for Rhacophorus, two new matrilines for Liuixalus, and
   Polypedates leucomystax species complex. Intraspecific genetic distances
   ranged from 0.000 to 0.119 and interspecific genetic distances ranged
   from 0.015 to 0.334. Within Rhacophorus and Kurixalus, the intra- and
   interspecific genetic distances did not reveal an obvious barcode gap.
   Notwithstanding, we found that COI sequences unambiguously identified
   rhacophorid species and helped to discover likely new cryptic species
   via the synthesis of genealogical relationships and divergence patterns.
   Our results supported that COI is an effective DNA barcoding marker for
   Rhacophoridae.},

Title = {Long-term memory is formed immediately without the need for protein
   synthesis-dependent consolidation in Drosophila},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {It is believed that long-term memory (LTM) cannot be formed immediately
   because it must go through a protein synthesis-dependent consolidation
   process. However, the current study uses Drosophila aversive olfactory
   conditioning to show that such processes are dispensable for
   context-dependent LTM (cLTM). Single-trial conditioning yields cLTM that
   is formed immediately in a protein-synthesis independent manner and is
   sustained over 14 days without decay. Unlike retrieval of traditional
   LTM, which requires only the conditioned odour and is mediated by
   mushroom-body neurons, cLTM recall requires both the conditioned odour
   and reinstatement of the training-environmental context. It is mediated
   through lateral-horn neurons that connect to multiple sensory brain
   regions. The cLTM cannot be retrieved if synaptic transmission from any
   one of these centres is blocked, with effects similar to those of
   altered encoding context during retrieval. The present study provides
   strong evidence that long-term memory can be formed easily without the
   need for consolidation.},

Title = {Differential conditioning produces merged long-term memory in Drosophila},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Multiple spaced trials of aversive differential conditioning can produce
   two independent long-term memories (LTMs) of opposite valence. One is an
   aversive memory for avoiding the conditioned stimulus (CS+), and the
   other is a safety memory for approaching the non-conditioned stimulus
   (CS-). Here, we show that a single trial of aversive differential
   conditioning yields one merged LTM (mLTM) for avoiding both CS+ and CS-.
   Such mLTM can be detected after sequential exposures to the shock-paired
   CS+ and -unpaired CS-, and be retrieved by either CS+ or CS-. The
   formation of mLTM relies on triggering aversive-reinforcing dopaminergic
   neurons and subsequent new protein synthesis. Expressing mLTM involves
   ab Kenyon cells and corresponding approach-directing mushroom body
   output neurons, in which similar-amplitude long-term depression of
   responses to CS+ and CS- seems to signal the mLTM. Our results suggest
   that animals can develop distinct strategies for occasional and repeated
   threatening experiences.},

Title = {Genetic dissection of mutual interference between two consecutive
   learning tasks in Drosophila},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {Animals can continuously learn different tasks to adapt to changing
   environments and, therefore, have strategies to effectively cope with
   inter-task interference, including both proactive interference (Pro-I)
   and retroactive interference (Retro-I). Many biological mechanisms are
   known to contribute to learning, memory, and forgetting for a single
   task, however, mechanisms involved only when learning sequential
   different tasks are relatively poorly understood. Here, we dissect the
   respective molecular mechanisms of Pro-I and Retro-I between two
   consecutive associative learning tasks in Drosophila. Pro-I is more
   sensitive to an inter-task interval (ITI) than Retro-I. They occur
   together at short ITI (<20 min), while only Retro-I remains significant
   at ITI beyond 20 min. Acutely overexpressing Corkscrew (CSW), an
   evolutionarily conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, in mushroom
   body (MB) neurons reduces Pro-I, whereas acute knockdown of CSW
   exacerbates Pro-I. Such function of CSW is further found to rely on the
   ? subset of MB neurons and the downstream Raf/MAPK pathway. In contrast,
   manipulating CSW does not affect Retro-I as well as a single learning
   task. Interestingly, manipulation of Rac1, a molecule that regulates
   Retro-I, does not affect Pro-I. Thus, our findings suggest that learning
   different tasks consecutively triggers distinct molecular mechanisms to
   tune proactive and retroactive interference.},
